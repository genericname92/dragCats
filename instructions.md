## Orderable

Write jQuery plugin for drag-and-drop image ordering. Images should display in a grid
and allow users to rearrange them by dragging and dropping from one position to 
another
* This should all happen client-side; you don't need a backend.
* You may use jQuery for basic DOM manipulation, but you should avoid higher-level
libraries such as jQuery UI
* Use Chrome as your base browser; don't worry about cross-browser support
* You have three hours to solve the problem

### Basic Goals
* Drag and drop photos in a chosen environment (for example, you may find a
  fixed number of rows or columns easier to work with)

### Advanced Goals
* Generalize your code: ensure that your solution works for any position and
a variety of layouts.
